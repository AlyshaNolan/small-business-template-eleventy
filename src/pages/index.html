          ### Provide all the necessary information


          There are many reasons a website should have a terms of use agreement.
          For example, a terms of use page would show the website is a
          legitimate operation and increase user confidence. However, the most
          important reasons a business should have a terms and conditions page
          are to limit the business's liability, prevent users from abusing the
          service, protect the site's intellectual property, and ensure that the
          users comply with the site's terms.
